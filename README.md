# ans-project
Little project for our applied network sciences class

# Goals
We want to work on the same idea as this study, which analysed whether the youtube algorithm leads to radicalization. We would like to explore the way political content on youtube networks and whether any structures emerge upon clicking on the next video starting from a certain point.

# Development
To spawn your shell in the venv that is managed by poetry, just execute the following command: 
```bash
poetry shell
``` 
Once in the poetry shell you can run python files as used to, by just running: `python path/to/script.py`.
